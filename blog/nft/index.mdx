This is my first NFT Marketplace ever written.
Overall this project was the most ambitious one yet.
It required writing two smart contracts in Solidity one
for handling the minitng of ERC1155 tokens and the second
contract for handling the sale of these tokens. Additionaly
a fronted for interacting with these contracts had to be provided
, for this reason I used ReactJS combined with NextJS.
Data from the blockchain that included: sales and possession of tokens had to be queried
from The Graph. Moreover a dedicated endpoint for storing profile data had to be provided.
